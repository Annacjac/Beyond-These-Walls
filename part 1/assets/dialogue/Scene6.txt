You: Now what?

Amy: Well, we got our map, so let's figure out our route towards the wall. You can look at the map again if you'd like.
You: If we head north, we can go straight through the woods and across the river, leading us right to the wall.
Amy: Sounds like a plan. 
Amy: Oh, and here's a lantern I took from the well. We'll need it to see out there.
You: Well, looks like we're as prepared as we can be. Are you ready to leave the village?
Amy: It's worth a shot. Let's go.
