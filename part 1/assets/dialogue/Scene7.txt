

You and Amy have successfully made it out of the village.
There are many strange noises as you weave through the trees. But in a way, it's more exciting than scary. You have your best friend at your side. Together you're doing something that's never been done, and the risk is exhilarating.
You look over at Amy. She's quiet. Her face seems troubled.
You: Are you okay?
Amy: Yeah. I'm fine. It sure is dark out here, though.
You: Hopefully we'll be out soon. These woods won't last forever.
Amy: I guess you're right.
You continue in silence for a few more minutes. Suddenly, you hear a twig snap distantly behind you. Amy grabs your hand.
You hear a voice shout from the distance, "You're not supposed to be out. Come on back."
The two of you exchange glances and realize your only options are to run or hide. 
If you run, you don't know how long you're going to continue being chased. If you hide, you should turn off the lantern before doing so to avoid being seen.
Still holding Amy's hand, you blindly try to find a place to hide, but you can't tell where you are. Click somewhere on the screen to hide there.
Still holding Amy's hand, you slip behind a nearby tree and wait.
Still holding Amy's hand, you both break out in a sprint, trying to be light on your feet so as not to draw too much attention.
