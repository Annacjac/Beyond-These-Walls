You sneak into the main square and see Amy waiting in the shadows.
Amy: Hey. I did some thinking. We're definitely going to need a few things.
You: Like what? 
Amy: Like a map. Have you ever been outside the village? No. We won't know where we're going.
Amy: Also, it's dark as hell out there. We need something to light our way.
You: So where are we getting all these things?
Amy: Not sure. I think we could probably look around and find something.
Look around and see what you can find.
