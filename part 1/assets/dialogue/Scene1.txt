Your mind isn't supposed to wander. But how has no one ever questioned it?
No one in the town of Stilldale has ever ventured past the walls that "protect" you, and not a soul has made its way in. And still, no one ever seems to talk about it, either.
Is there anything out there? Are there any people besides you and your neighbors? Or is it just an empty void beyond the wall?
You've had these thoughts for quite some time, but there seems to be an unspoken condemnation of anyone who tries to explore.
You continue to think as you walk through town. It's almost sundown, and you're not supposed to be out past then.
You hear a familiar voice behind you. Your best friend, Amy, joins you by your side.
Amy: Hey! Headed home?
You: Hey, Amy. Yeah, unfortunately.
Amy: Unfortunately? Is something bothering you?
You pull her behind a house where no one can see.
You: Listen, can you keep a secret?
Amy: Of course.
You: I've been trying to ignore it, but... I've been thinking. About the wall.
Amy: The wall? Like the one around the town?
You: Yes. Haven't you ever wondered what's out there? There's gotta be more than just this, right?
Amy: Sometimes.
You: Sometimes?
Amy: Okay, a lot of times. I think about it constantly, actually, but we really aren't supposed to be talking about this.
You: I know, but I haven't been able to stop thinking once in over two years. I think...
Amy: Yeah?
You: I think I want to go see what's out there. And I was hoping you would come with me.
Amy: What? Are you serious? We can't just leave.
You: What else is there for us here? We've already graduated school, and we're basically stuck farming for the rest of our lives. There has to be more to life than this.
Amy: ...I guess you're right. I have thought about it a lot. Do you have a plan?
You and Amy spend the next few minutes hastily coming up with a time and place to meet up. Before you realize it, the sun is already dipping behind the horizon. 
You quickly say goodbye and hurry back to your house.
