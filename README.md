# Beyond These Walls
A point-and-click/text-based video game programmed in Java and Twine for a Video Game Writing course.

You live in a village surrounded by a large wall where everything has been the same for hundreds of years. Every day, you've been more and more curious as to what's beyond the wall, but you know its against the rules. One day, you convince your best friend to help you escape, searching around the village for items that will help you with your adventure, as well as running into some problems along the way.

This game was made for a class project. As I was under a time crunch, I had to make it in 2 parts, one in Java, and one in Twine. 

Instructions for part 1:
1. Download the entire "Part 1" folder.
2. Install Java on your system if it is not installed already.
3. Run "Beyond These Walls - Part 1.exe"
4. Play up until the Run or Hide scene. You will be unable to continue playing after this.

Instructions for part 2:
1. After completing part one, download "part 2.html" and run it.

Thank you for playing and enjoy!
